## What is Flux?
Flux is a MCP server built to work with AO and Arweave allowing AI to directly interact with AO along with code genration right in the code editor or AI tool you're using as long as they have MCP support.

## But what are MCPs?
MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, which is a protocol that allows AI models to interact with external systems and APIs in a structured way. It enables the AI to send and receive messages, making it possible to integrate AI capabilities into various applications and services.
You can read more about MCPs [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs)

## Features Implemented
- Run AO code using just natural languagea
- Create and run custom AO code/blueprints completely using natural language
- Integrates with your existing AI dev tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Claude, and anything that supports MCP tool calling
- Can test out all the code it pushes to an process
- Can create and test complex handlers

## Features to be implemented
- Inetgration with AO ecosystem tools
- Better code generation capabilities by adding more context about AO

## Tech stack
- AO
- Arweave
- MCP typescript sdk
- Typescript
- Node.js
