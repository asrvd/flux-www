description: Installing and setting up Flux
---
There are currently two ways to install and use Flux, right now it has been tested significantly only on Cursor so we will be showing how to install FLux in Cursor -

### Local Setup
For users who want everything to be present locally, no remote servers involved
    - Make sure you have latest stable version of NODE.js installed - [Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - Copy the content of the file [local/index.js](src/local/index.js) to your local machine in any folder and copy the absolute path
    - Open Cursor and go to **Settings** > **Cursor Settings** > **MCP** > **Add new MCP tool**
    - Paste this code in the file 
        ```json
        "mcpServers": {
            "flux": {
                "command": "node /path/to/your/local/index.js",
            }
        }
        ```
    - if you did everything correctly you will be able to see the flux MCP loaded with all the tools, and its ready to be used in Cursor!

### Remote Setup
For users who want to use Flux without installing anything locally
    - Open Cursor and go to **Settings** > **Cursor Settings** > **MCP** > **Add new MCP tool**
    - Paste this code in the file 
        ```json
        "mcpServers": {
            "flux": {
                "url": "https://flux-2esw.onrender.com/sse",
            }
        }
        ```
    - if you did everything correctly you will be able to see the flux MCP loaded with all the tools, and its ready to be used in Cursor!
