<Callout title="Please note">
  Local setup is more reliable right now and we recommend using it. Also, try reloading Cursor or refreshing the MCP server if you get any errors.
</Callout>
### Local Setup
For users who want everything to be present locally, no remote servers involved
    - Make sure you have latest stable version of NODE.js installed - [Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - Open Cursor and go to **Settings** > **Cursor Settings** > **MCP** > **Add new MCP tool**
    - Paste this code in the file 
        ```json
        "mcpServers": {
            "flux": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": ["-y", "flux-ao@latest"]
            }
        }
        ```
    - if you did everything correctly you will be able to see the flux MCP loaded with all the tools, and its ready to be used in Cursor!

### Remote Setup
For users who want to use Flux without installing anything locally
    - Open Cursor and go to **Settings** > **Cursor Settings** > **MCP** > **Add new MCP tool**
    - Paste this code in the file 
        ```json
        "mcpServers": {
            "flux": {
                "url": "https://flux-2esw.onrender.com/sse",
            }
        }
        ```
    - if you did everything correctly you will be able to see the flux MCP loaded with all the tools, and its ready to be used in Cursor!
