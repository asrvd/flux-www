<Callout title="Please note">
  MCP support in VSCode is still in preview and we don't recommend using flux
  with VSCode till it's stable. You can check out more details about it
  [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).
</Callout>

### Local Setup
For users who want everything to be present locally, no remote servers involved
    - Make sure you have latest stable version of NODE.js installed - [Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - Copy the content of the file [local/index.js](https://github.com/asrvd/flux/blob/main/src/local/index.js) to your local machine in any folder and copy the absolute path
    - Open VSCode and create a **settings.json** file in the **.vscode** folder in your project directory's root like this -
    <Files>
        <Folder name=".vscode" defaultOpen>
            <File name="settings.json" />
        </Folder>
        <Folder name="src">
            <File name="app" />
            <File name="libs" />
            <File name="utils" />
        </Folder>
        <File name="package.json" />
    </Files>
    - Paste this code in the file and save it
        ```json
        {
            "mcp": {
                "inputs": [],
                "servers": {
                    "flux": {
                        "command": "node",
                        "args": ["/path/to/your/local/index.js"],
                        "type": "stdio"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    - If you did everything correctly you will be able to see the flux MCP loaded with all the tools, and its ready to be used in VSCode!

### Remote Setup
For users who want to use Flux without installing anything locally
    - Open VSCode and create a **settings.json** file in the **.vscode** folder in your project directory's root like this -
    <Files>
        <Folder name=".vscode" defaultOpen>
            <File name="settings.json" />
        </Folder>
        <Folder name="src">
            <File name="app" />
            <File name="libs" />
            <File name="utils" />
        </Folder>
        <File name="package.json" />
    </Files>
    - Paste this code in the file 
        ```json
        {
            "mcp": {
                "inputs": [],
                "servers": {
                    "flux": {
                        "url": "https://flux-2esw.onrender.com/sse",
                        "type": "sse"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    - if you did everything correctly you will be able to see the flux MCP loaded with all the tools, and its ready to be used in VSCode!
