We would suggest you add the [`llms.txt`](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/llms-full.txt) for AO docs in cursor first and use it as a context before you start using the MCP server. If you don't know how to do it, checkoout [this documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs) on how to add docs to cursor.

The more context you give to cursor, the more acurate the responses will be.

Now add these custom rules in your Cursor project to make sure Cursor doesn't hallucinate or give wrong responses. You can add these rules in the **Settings** > **Cursor Settings** > **Rules** > **Add new rule**.

```txt
For adding json capabilities ONLY IF NEEDED, you need to add a line "local json = require("json")" on top of file. BUT DONT USE IT UNLESS NEEDED. SIMPLE THINGS CAN BE DONE USING AO PROCESS STATE

Always use Send instead of msg.reply

Always make sure a handler is sending out a response/reply (using Send) and send it as data as well instaed of just returning using tags

Never add any tags by yourself, always add tags when needed or instructed by user, also {"Action":"Eval"} tag is for running lua in an ao process and {"Action" : "action_name"} is for running a handler

Never add the "Type" tag to anything, thats reserved for internal ao specifications

Always use Handler.utils whever possible when creating a handler, for example --
    Handlers.add(
        "pingpong",
        Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag("Action", "Ping"),
        function (msg) 
            Handlers.utils.reply("Pong")(msg) -- or use Send() here
        end
    )
```

Now you can start using the Flux MCP server in Cursor Agents.
